# bluesky-web
Composable bluesky user interface components for web browsers/clients

This is an early stage exploration for collaborativerly developing a library of components, patterns, ground rules, etc. that will simplify composing and deploying web clients for experiment controls and the acquisition, visualization, and analysis of data.

Initially the focus of this project is to document discussions, decisions, priorities, etc. Shared code will be committed as we experiment and jointly develop the intended library.

Open an issue to start a discussion.
